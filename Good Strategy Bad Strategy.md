- Good strategy almost always looks this
    - simple and obvious and does not take a thick deck of PowerPoint slides to explain. 
    - It does not pop out of some “strategic management” tool, matrix, chart, triangle, or fill-in-the-blanks scheme. 
    - Instead, a talented leader identifies the one or two critical issues in the situation—the pivot points that can
multiply the effectiveness of effort—and then focuses and concentrates action and resources on them.
- Despite the roar of voices wanting to equate strategy with ambition, leadership, “vision,” planning,
or the economic logic of competition, strategy is none of these. 
- The core of strategy work is always the same: discovering the critical factors in a situation and designing a way of coordinating and
focusing actions to deal with those factors.

- A leader’s most important responsibility is identifying the biggest challenges to forward progress
and devising a coherent approach to overcoming them. In contexts ranging from corporate direction to
national security, strategy matters. Yet we have become so accustomed to strategy as exhortation that
we hardly blink an eye when a leader spouts slogans and announces high-sounding goals, calling the
mixture a “strategy.” Here are four examples of this syndrome.
    -  The event was a “strategy retreat.” The CEO had modeled it on a similar event at British
Airways he had attended several years before. About two hundred upper-level managers from
around the world gathered in a hotel ballroom where top management presented a vision for
the future: to be the most respected and successful company in their field. There was a
specially produced motion picture featuring the firm’s products and services being used in
colorful settings around the world. There was an address by the CEO accompanied by dramatic music to highlight the company’s “strategic” goals: global leadership, growth, and
high shareholder return. There were breakouts into smaller groups to allow discussion and
buy-in. There was a colorful release of balloons. There was everything but strategy. As an
invited guest, I was disappointed but not surprised.
    - A specialist in bonds, Lehman Brothers had been a pioneer in the new wave of mortgage-
backed securities that buoyed Wall Street in the 2002–6 period. By 2006, signs of strain were
appearing: U.S. home sales had peaked in mid-2005, and home price appreciation had
stopped. A small increase in the Fed’s interest rate had triggered an increase in foreclosures.
Lehman CEO Richard Fuld’s response, formalized in 2006, was a “strategy” of continuing to
gain market share by growing faster than the rest of the industry. In the language of Wall Street,
Lehman would do this by increasing its “risk appetite.” That is, it would take on the deals its
competitors were rejecting. Operating with only 3 percent equity, and much of its debt
supplied on a very short-term basis, this policy should have been accompanied by clever
ways of mitigating the increased risk. A good strategy recognizes the nature of the challenge
and offers a way of surmounting it. Simply being ambitious is not a strategy. In 2008, Lehman
Brothers ended its 158 years as an investment bank with a crash that sent the global financial
system into a tailspin. Here, the consequences of bad strategy were disastrous for Lehman, the
United States, and the world.
    - In 2003, President George W. Bush authorized the U.S. military to invade and conquer Iraq.
The invasion went quickly. Once the army-to-army fighting stopped, administration leaders
had expected to oversee a rapid transition to a democratic civil society in Iraq. Instead, as a
violent insurgency gathered momentum, individual units of the U.S. military fell back on
running “search and destroy” missions out of secure bases—the same approach that had failed
so badly in Vietnam. There were numerous high-sounding goals—freedom, democracy,
reconstruction, security—but no coherent strategy for dealing with the insurgency.
The change came in 2007. Having just written the Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency
Field Manual, General David Petraeus was sent to Iraq, along with five additional brigades of
troops. But more than the extra soldiers, Petraeus was armed with an actual strategy. His idea
was that one could combat an insurgency as long as the large preponderance of civilians
supported a legitimate government. The trick was to shift the military’s focus from making
patrols to protecting the populace. A populace that was not in fear of insurgent retaliation would
provide the information necessary to isolate and combat the insurgent minority. This change,
replacing amorphous goals with a true problem-solving strategy, made an enormous difference in
the results achieved.
    -  In November 2006, I attended a short conference about Web 2.0 businesses. The term “Web
2.0” purportedly referred to a new approach to Web services, but none of the technologies
involved were really new. The term was actually a code word for Google, MySpace,
YouTube, Facebook, and various other new Web-based businesses that had suddenly become
very valuable. At lunch, I found myself seated with seven other attendees at a round table.
Someone asked me what I do. I briefly explained that I was a faculty member at UCLA where
I taught and did research on strategy—and that I was a consultant on the subject to a variety of
organizations. The CEO of a Web-services company was sitting directly across from me. He put down his
fork and said, “Strategy is never quitting until you win.” I could not have disagreed more, but I
was not there to argue or lecture. “Winning is better than losing,” I said, and the conversation
turned to other matters.
