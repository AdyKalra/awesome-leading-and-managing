- Good strategy almost always looks this
    - simple and obvious and does not take a thick deck of PowerPoint slides to explain. 
    - It does not pop out of some “strategic management” tool, matrix, chart, triangle, or fill-in-the-blanks scheme. 
    - Instead, a talented leader identifies the one or two critical issues in the situation—the pivot points that can
multiply the effectiveness of effort—and then focuses and concentrates action and resources on them.
- Despite the roar of voices wanting to equate strategy with ambition, leadership, “vision,” planning,
or the economic logic of competition, strategy is none of these. 
- The core of strategy work is always the same: discovering the critical factors in a situation and designing a way of coordinating and
focusing actions to deal with those factors.

- A leader’s most important responsibility is identifying the biggest challenges to forward progress
and devising a coherent approach to overcoming them. In contexts ranging from corporate direction to
national security, strategy matters. Yet we have become so accustomed to strategy as exhortation that
we hardly blink an eye when a leader spouts slogans and announces high-sounding goals, calling the
mixture a “strategy.” Here are four examples of this syndrome.
    -  The event was a “strategy retreat.” The CEO had modeled it on a similar event at British
Airways he had attended several years before. About two hundred upper-level managers from
around the world gathered in a hotel ballroom where top management presented a vision for
the future: to be the most respected and successful company in their field. There was a
specially produced motion picture featuring the firm’s products and services being used in
colorful settings around the world. There was an address by the CEO accompanied by dramatic music to highlight the company’s “strategic” goals: global leadership, growth, and
high shareholder return. There were breakouts into smaller groups to allow discussion and
buy-in. There was a colorful release of balloons. There was everything but strategy. As an
invited guest, I was disappointed but not surprised.
    - A specialist in bonds, Lehman Brothers had been a pioneer in the new wave of mortgage-
backed securities that buoyed Wall Street in the 2002–6 period. By 2006, signs of strain were
appearing: U.S. home sales had peaked in mid-2005, and home price appreciation had
stopped. A small increase in the Fed’s interest rate had triggered an increase in foreclosures.
Lehman CEO Richard Fuld’s response, formalized in 2006, was a “strategy” of continuing to
gain market share by growing faster than the rest of the industry. In the language of Wall Street,
Lehman would do this by increasing its “risk appetite.” That is, it would take on the deals its
competitors were rejecting. Operating with only 3 percent equity, and much of its debt
supplied on a very short-term basis, this policy should have been accompanied by clever
ways of mitigating the increased risk. A good strategy recognizes the nature of the challenge
and offers a way of surmounting it. Simply being ambitious is not a strategy. In 2008, Lehman
Brothers ended its 158 years as an investment bank with a crash that sent the global financial
system into a tailspin. Here, the consequences of bad strategy were disastrous for Lehman, the
United States, and the world.
    - In 2003, President George W. Bush authorized the U.S. military to invade and conquer Iraq.
The invasion went quickly. Once the army-to-army fighting stopped, administration leaders
had expected to oversee a rapid transition to a democratic civil society in Iraq. Instead, as a
violent insurgency gathered momentum, individual units of the U.S. military fell back on
running “search and destroy” missions out of secure bases—the same approach that had failed
so badly in Vietnam. There were numerous high-sounding goals—freedom, democracy,
reconstruction, security—but no coherent strategy for dealing with the insurgency.
The change came in 2007. Having just written the Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency
Field Manual, General David Petraeus was sent to Iraq, along with five additional brigades of
troops. But more than the extra soldiers, Petraeus was armed with an actual strategy. His idea
was that one could combat an insurgency as long as the large preponderance of civilians
supported a legitimate government. The trick was to shift the military’s focus from making
patrols to protecting the populace. A populace that was not in fear of insurgent retaliation would
provide the information necessary to isolate and combat the insurgent minority. This change,
replacing amorphous goals with a true problem-solving strategy, made an enormous difference in
the results achieved.
    -  In November 2006, I attended a short conference about Web 2.0 businesses. The term “Web
2.0” purportedly referred to a new approach to Web services, but none of the technologies
involved were really new. The term was actually a code word for Google, MySpace,
YouTube, Facebook, and various other new Web-based businesses that had suddenly become
very valuable. At lunch, I found myself seated with seven other attendees at a round table.
Someone asked me what I do. I briefly explained that I was a faculty member at UCLA where
I taught and did research on strategy—and that I was a consultant on the subject to a variety of
organizations. The CEO of a Web-services company was sitting directly across from me. He put down his
fork and said, “Strategy is never quitting until you win.” I could not have disagreed more, but I
was not there to argue or lecture. “Winning is better than losing,” I said, and the conversation
turned to other matters.

- Strategy cannot be a useful concept if it is a synonym for
success. Nor can it be a useful tool if it is confused with ambition, determination, inspirational
leadership, and innovation. Ambition is drive and zeal to excel. Determination is commitment and
grit. Innovation is the discovery and engineering of new ways to do things. Inspirational leadership
motivates people to sacrifice for their own and the common good.
 And strategy, responsive to
innovation and ambition, selects the path, identifying how, why, and where leadership and
determination are to be applied.
- A word that can mean anything has lost its bite. To give content to a concept one has to draw lines,
marking off what it denotes and what it does not. To begin the journey toward clarity, it is helpful to recognize that the words “strategy” and “strategic” are often sloppily used to mark decisions made by
the highest-level officials. For example, in business, most mergers and acquisitions, investments in
expensive new facilities, negotiations with important suppliers and customers, and overall
organizational design are normally considered to be “strategic.” However, when you speak of
“strategy,” you should not be simply marking the pay grade of the decision maker. Rather, the term
“strategy” should mean a cohesive response to an important challenge. Unlike a stand-alone decision
or a goal, a strategy is a coherent set of analyses, concepts, policies, arguments, and actions that
respond to a high-stakes challenge.
- Many people assume that a strategy is a big-picture overall direction, divorced from any specific
action. But defining strategy as broad concepts, thereby leaving out action, creates a wide chasm
between “strategy” and “implementation.” If you accept this chasm, most strategy work becomes
wheel spinning. Indeed, this is the most common complaint about “strategy.” Echoing many others,
one top executive told me, “We have a sophisticated strategy process, but there is a huge problem of
execution. We almost always fall short of the goals we set for ourselves.” If you have followed my
line of argument, you can see the reason for this complaint. A good strategy includes a set of coherent
actions. They are not “implementation” details; they are the punch in the strategy. A strategy that fails
to define a variety of plausible and feasible immediate actions is missing a critical component.


- A good strategy has an essential logical structure that I call the kernel. The kernel of a strategy
contains three elements: a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and coherent action. The guiding policy
specifies the approach to dealing with the obstacles called out in the diagnosis. It is like a signpost,
marking the direction forward but not defining the details of the trip. Coherent actions are feasible
coordinated policies, resource commitments, and actions designed to carry out the guiding policy
- Bad strategy is more than just the absence of good strategy. Bad strategy has a life and logic of its own, a false edifice built on mistaken foundations. Bad strategy may actively avoid analyzing
obstacles because a leader believes that negative thoughts get in the way. Leaders may create bad
strategy by mistakenly treating strategy work as an exercise in goal setting rather than problem
solving. Or they may avoid hard choices because they do not wish to offend anyone—generating a
bad strategy that tries to cover all the bases rather than focus resources and actions.

- The most basic idea of strategy is the application of strength against weakness. Or, if you prefer,
strength applied to the most promising opportunity. The standard modern treatment of strategy has
expanded this idea into a rich discussion of potential strengths, today called “advantages.” There are
advantages due to being a first mover: scale, scope, network effects, reputation, patents, brands, and
hundreds more. None of these are logically wrong, and each can be important. Yet this whole
midlevel framework misses two huge, incredibly important natural sources of strength:
    1. Having a coherent strategy—one that coordinates policies and actions. A good strategy
doesn’t just draw on existing strength; it creates strength through the coherence of its design.
Most organizations of any size don’t do this. Rather, they pursue multiple objectives that are
unconnected with one another or, worse, that conflict with one another.
    2. The creation of new strengths through subtle shifts in viewpoint. An insightful reframing of a
competitive situation can create whole new patterns of advantage and weakness. The most
powerful strategies arise from such game-changing insights.

- Having conflicting goals, dedicating resources to unconnected targets, and accommodating
incompatible interests are the luxuries of the rich and powerful, but they make for bad strategy.
Despite this, most organizations will not create focused strategies. Instead, they will generate laundry
lists of desirable outcomes and, at the same time, ignore the need for genuine competence in
coordinating and focusing their resources. Good strategy requires leaders who are willing and able to
say no to a wide variety of actions and interests. Strategy is at least as much about what an
organization does not do as it is about what it does.

- Bad strategy is not simply the absence of good strategy. It grows out of specific misconceptions
and leadership dysfunctions. Once you develop the ability to detect bad strategy, you will
dramatically improve your effectiveness at judging, influencing, and creating strategy. To detect a bad
strategy, look for one or more of its four major hallmarks:
    - Fluf . Fluff is a form of gibberish masquerading as strategic concepts or arguments. It uses
“Sunday” words (words that are inflated and unnecessarily abstruse) and apparently esoteric
concepts to create the illusion of high-level thinking.
    - Failure to face the challenge. Bad strategy fails to recognize or define the challenge. When
you cannot define the challenge, you cannot evaluate a strategy or improve it.
    - Mistaking goals for strategy. Many bad strategies are just statements of desire rather than
plans for overcoming obstacles.
    - Bad strategic objectives. A strategic objective is set by a leader as a means to an end.
Strategic objectives are “bad” when they fail to address critical issues or when they are
impracticable.
