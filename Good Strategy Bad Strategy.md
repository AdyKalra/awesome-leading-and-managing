- Good strategy almost always looks this
    - simple and obvious and does not take a thick deck of PowerPoint slides to explain. 
    - It does not pop out of some “strategic management” tool, matrix, chart, triangle, or fill-in-the-blanks scheme. 
    - Instead, a talented leader identifies the one or two critical issues in the situation—the pivot points that can
multiply the effectiveness of effort—and then focuses and concentrates action and resources on them.
- Despite the roar of voices wanting to equate strategy with ambition, leadership, “vision,” planning,
or the economic logic of competition, strategy is none of these. 
- The core of strategy work is always the same: discovering the critical factors in a situation and designing a way of coordinating and
focusing actions to deal with those factors.
