    * Expert is a perception.It is socially created and agreed upon idea. **And to create a perception, you must show your face , they must hear your voice, read your words , encounter you and experience you.**

They think about thier industry, fixate on it, care about it, worry about it, wish they could change it, speak to it, interact with it, affect it, assist it in growing it. Their love of it is palpable and that is already most of the battle won."
