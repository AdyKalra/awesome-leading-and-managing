* This quote changed my life faster than I ever thought possible and it really is the catalyst for the Miracle Morning. 
    * And he said **"Your level of success "will seldom exceed your level of personal development, "because success is something you attract "by the person you become."** And in that moment, I went "I'm not dedicating time every day to my personal development, therefore, I'm not becoming the person that I need to be to create the success that I want in my life." And I had this epiphany that I got to go figure out what the world's most successful people do for their personal development
* **Practice silence for greater clarity**
    * So I'll look at my schedule, and I'll go okay, what do I need to accomplish today. And, you know, depends on what's on the agenda, like I just finished writing a new book, and when I was working on that book, every day, every morning, you know I meditate before I'd write
    * Another way to do it is, sometimes I might have a speech for that day, and I'd go, I need to feel confident. I am speaking, and I will literally just affirm things while I am in my meditation, and I'll just affirm things like, what did I do today.
    * But ultimately, I typically will have a specific result that I want to generate internally, either mentally or emotionally, and I will set that intention going into meditation, and I will use the meditation actively to do that. So I will think something over and over and over and over, while I deeply feel it in a way that will serve me for the rest of the day.
* **Make truthful affirmations**
    * An affirmation is simply a written statement that directs your focus towards something of value. 
    * Craft your affirmations as commitments
    * There's four steps to create affirmations that produce results. 
      * Number one is affirm what you're committed to.
      * The second thing is why is that deeply meaningful to you?
      * number three is affirm what specifically you're committed to doing that will ensure your success, right
      * And then the fourth part of the affirmation formula is, when specifically are you committed to implementing those activities?
